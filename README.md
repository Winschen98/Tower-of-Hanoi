# Project Description
A simple implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle where the user will start with 3 stacks and all disc stacked onto the left-most stack. The user's goal will be to take every disc from the left-most stack and move it to the right-most stack without placing a bigger disc on top of a smaller disc.

This game was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

Have fun sharpening your problem solving skills!

As a player, I want to be able to move the individual discs, so that if I move every disc to the right stack while following the rules I will be rewarded with the winning display.
