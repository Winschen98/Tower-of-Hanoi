# Project Description
A simple implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle where the player starts with 3 stacks and all disk stacked onto the left-most stack. The player's goal will be to take every disk from the left-most stack and move it to the right-most stack without placing a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk. Each round will be timed and moves will be counted so quick thinking will be the key to success. 
As you advance through the levels of the Tower of Hanoi, more disk will be added to the stack, presenting another layer of complexity. Are you up for the challenge?

# User Stories
As a causal player I want to be able to move the individual discs such that if I move every disk to the right stack while following the rules I will be rewarded with the winning display. 
As a competitive player I want to be able to track my moves and time as I improve with each iteration.
As a developer I want to break down the game into progressive levels to keep my player's engaged. 

# Hurdles 
Many of the hurdles I encountered revolved around the CSS implementation of my game logic. Even with my JavaScript logic being sound it was difficult at times to coordinate the CSS to animate certain aspects of the game in the manner I envisioned.
